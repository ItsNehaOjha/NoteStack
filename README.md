NoteStack ApplicationA full-stack note-taking application built with a Node.js/Express backend and a modern frontend. This project is designed for easy development and seamless deployment.‚ú® FeaturesCreate, Read, Update, and Delete notes.RESTful API for managing notes.Responsive Frontend built for a great user experience.Production-Ready server configuration.Easy Deployment to cloud services like Render.üõ†Ô∏è Tech StackBackend: Node.js, Express.jsFrontend: (Please specify your frontend, e.g., React, Vue, Svelte)Database: (Please specify your database, e.g., MongoDB, PostgreSQL)Deployment: Render, Docker, etc.üöÄ Getting StartedFollow these instructions to get the project up and running on your local machine.PrerequisitesNode.js (version 18.x or higher recommended)npm (usually comes with Node.js)A .env file in the root directory (see configuration below)1. Clone the Repositorygit clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git)
cd your-repo-name
2. Install DependenciesInstall the necessary packages for both the backend and frontend.# Install backend dependencies from the root directory
npm install

# Navigate to the frontend directory and install its dependencies
cd frontend
npm install

# Return to the root directory
cd ..
3. Environment ConfigurationCreate a .env file in the root directory of the project and add the following variables. Replace the placeholder values with your actual configuration.# .env

# Server Port
PORT=5001

# Your Database Connection String
# Example for MongoDB:
# MONGO_URI="mongodb+srv://<user>:<password>@cluster0.xxxxx.mongodb.net/yourDatabaseName?retryWrites=true&w=majority"

# Set Node Environment
# Use "development" for local development
# Use "production" for deployment
NODE_ENV=development
üèÉ Running the ApplicationDevelopment ModeTo run the application locally with hot-reloading for both the frontend and backend, use the development command.# This command typically starts both the frontend and backend servers concurrently
npm run dev
The frontend will be available at http://localhost:5173 (or your configured port) and the backend API at http://localhost:5001.Production Mode (Local)To simulate the production environment on your local machine:Set Environment: Change the NODE_ENV variable in your .env file to production.NODE_ENV=production
Build the Frontend: Generate the static frontend files.npm run build
Start the Server: Run the application. The Express server will now serve both the API and the built frontend.npm run start
The application will be available at http://localhost:5001.üì¶ Build & DeploymentThis project is configured for easy deployment on services like Render.com.1. Commit and Push to GitMake sure all your latest changes are committed and pushed to your GitHub repository.git add .
git commit -m "feat: Prepare for deployment"
git push
2. Deploy on RenderCreate a new "Web Service" on Render and connect your GitHub repository.Use the following settings during the setup:Environment: NodeBuild Command: npm run buildStart Command: npm run startAdd your production environment variables (like PORT, MONGO_URI, and NODE_ENV=production) in the Environment tab in your Render service settings.Render will automatically build and deploy your application. Future pushes to your connected branch will trigger automatic redeployments.üìù LicenseThis project is licensed under the MIT License. See the LICENSE file for details.
